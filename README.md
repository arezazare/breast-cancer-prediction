# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This machine learning project predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using structured diagnostic data. It demonstrates a full classification pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- **Size**: 569 rows × 32 columns
- **Target Variable**: `Diagnosis` (Malignant / Benign)
- **Features**: Cell nucleus measurements such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🧪 Key Tasks
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for distribution, correlation, and feature relevance
- Feature selection to improve model performance
- Classification using multiple machine learning models

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Network (optional)
- **Best Accuracy**: 98% with Logistic Regression

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git / GitHub

## 📈 Results
The final model accurately predicted cancer diagnosis. Feature selection and EDA helped improve accuracy and interpretability. Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed best.
