# 🧠 Brain Tumor Type Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This medical machine learning project predicts brain tumor types using structured data and exploratory analysis. Focused on classification and performance evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)
- **Size**: 569 rows × 32 columns
- **Target Variable**: `Diagnosis` (Malignant / Benign)
- **Features**: Cell nucleus characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.

## 🧪 Key Tasks
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- EDA to understand class distributions and correlations
- Feature extraction from structured inputs
- Classification modeling

## 🧠 Models Used
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Neural Networks (optional)
- Achieved Accuracy: 92% with Neural Network

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras if DL used)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git / GitHub

## 📈 Results
Final model successfully classified tumor types with high accuracy. Feature selection improved model interpretability and performance.
